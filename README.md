# db_fetch_webservice_post_example


Basic idea behind this to query a db do some minimal parsing and then via a rest webservice call post the data to a
server elsewhere.

This script is just an example and was not based on any real data or servers

The fictional DB table named 'DATA' is configured as shown below

ID      GUIID      MACHINE_ID        PRODUCTION_RATE       EPOCH_TIME
 1      ABC1234     machine1            25                  4864382
 2      DEF789A     machine2            14                  4864389
